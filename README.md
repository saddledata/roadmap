SaddleData Public Roadmap

Welcome to the official public roadmap for SaddleData! This repository provides visibility into our product development process. It's where we track what we're working on, what's coming up next, and where we gather essential feedback from our community of users.

We believe in building in public and want to give you a voice in shaping the future of SaddleData.

Please Note: This roadmap is for informational purposes only and is subject to change. Priorities can shift based on customer feedback, market changes, and new opportunities.

The Roadmap: Now, Next, Later

We use the "Now, Next, Later" framework to communicate our priorities.

✅ Recently Shipped

Real-Time Enterprise Streaming

🚀 High-Performance Stream Agents: Double-buffered architecture with asynchronous stats reporting, enabling high-volume bursts and sub-second latency for enterprise streaming flows.

🚀 WebSocket Gateway Optimization: Tuned the stream-gateway for larger fetch sizes and reduced latency, including automatic ws:// to wss:// protocol upgrades for seamless traversal through cloud load balancers.

🚀 Streaming UI Dashboard: Tailored Flow Detail pages specifically for real-time throughput, hiding irrelevant batch metrics and replacing them with persistent Total Rows and Total Errors counters.

New Connectors

🚀 ClickHouse Destination: High-throughput, batch-optimized event streaming into ClickHouse for real-time analytics.

🚀 Google Analytics 4 (GA4) Source: Extracting raw event and traffic data from GA4 properties.

🚀 Webhook Source: High-throughput event ingestion gateway with built-in rate limiting and buffering (Redis-backed).

🚀 MongoDB Source: Automatic flattening of BSON documents to SQL tables.

🚀 Snowflake Destination: Enterprise-grade loading using internal stages for high volume and Merge support for upserts.

🚀 Databricks Destination: Native integration for Delta Lake.

Observability & Monitoring

🚀 Advanced Streaming Observability: Ingestion error tracking detects webhook failures (e.g., rate limits/body read errors) and pushes them directly to the flow's health dashboard.

🚀 Observability & Alerting Engine: Real-time Activity Feed and Alert Rules. All stream lifecycle events (Success, Failure, Recovery, Warnings) provide a clear audit trail.

🚀 Remote Agent Monitoring: Heartbeat tracking for self-hosted agents with automated "Agent Offline" alerting.

Core Infrastructure & Security

🚀 Agent Resilience & Self-Healing: Non-blocking connection logic prevents panics during destination DB blips. Includes automatic reconciliation loops to restart failed streams and handle "zombie" consumers.

🚀 Developer Experience (DX): Streamlined local agent testing with SADDLEDATA_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY and standardized API URL environment variables.

🚀 Security: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA/MFA): Secured user accounts with TOTP-based authentication.

🚀 Remote Agents (Hybrid Data Plane): Securely run Saddle Data workers inside your own VPC or infrastructure with zero-trust outbound-only polling.

AI & Automation

🚀 Intelligent Data Mapper: Smart schema inference right in the flow editor that profiles source data and auto-suggests optimal mappings and data types.

🚀 Saddle Data AI SRE: Autonomous error diagnosis for failed flows. It analyzes worker logs to explain failures in plain English.

Transformations & Activation

🚀 Reverse ETL Templates: Pre-built patterns for syncing warehouse data back to operational tools.

🚀 dbt Core Integration: Native support for running dbt projects immediately after data ingestion.

🚀 Visual Schema Mapping: Explicit control over destination column types (Schema Mapping) with intelligent implicit casting.

🚧 In Progress

Self-Serve UI Telemetry: Implementing a lightweight, first-party tracking SDK to pipe UI usage data directly into our own real-time streaming infrastructure for dogfooding and analytics.

📝 Next (Up Next)

Webhook & Slack Alert Destinations: Expanding the Alerting Engine to support generic webhooks and native Slack integrations.

Fanout DAG Dependencies: Support for triggering multiple downstream flows from a single upstream flow (One-to-Many orchestration).

Shopify Source (OAuth): Upgrading the Shopify connector to a Public App model for easier one-click onboarding.

💡 Later / Ideas

ClickHouse Source: Reverse ETL capabilities to extract aggregated metrics from ClickHouse and sync them back to operational tools.

Vector Database Destinations: Connectors for Pinecone, Weaviate, and Milvus to power AI RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) directly from operational data.

Unstructured Data Parsing (AI Ingestion): Ingest PDFs, Word docs, and images from S3/Google Drive, using AI to extract structured JSON on the fly.

Data Quality Observability: Proactive alerting for "Inference Integrity." Detect anomalies in the data itself (e.g., alert if a critical column suddenly returns 80% NULL values).

Developer API & Token Management: API token generation to allow programmatic access to Saddle Data.

Smart Schema Defaults: Community-powered auto-mapping suggestions for common data sources.

S3 / GCS Data Lake Destination: Outputting data as Parquet/Iceberg files.

GitOps (Flows as Code): Manage Saddle Data pipeline configurations natively via Git pull requests.
